Back end
These should be submitted via a link to a public github repo with properly formatted [markdown] in a README.md file:

Datatbase Tables Quickly draw out the tables with all their columns and data types for each model in your project. You should be able to point out the foreign keys, and explain relationships between your models using relational database languange ("one to many, user has many dogs, dog belongs to user").
For future reference, this is often done with ERDs. Here's a resource on creating an ERD (an Entity Relationship Diagram, or database diagram). For this project, tables and relations are sufficient, but use ERDs for mapping out database relationship for future projects.

Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app. This should look something like this or this (but should include all routes in your app, including authentication).
